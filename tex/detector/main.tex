\chapter{The ATLAS Detector}

The ATLAS experiment is one of the four large experiments at the Large
Hadron Collider (LHC) located at the European
Council for Nuclear Research (CERN) outside of Geneva,
Switzerland. Buried between 45 m and 170 m under the French-Swiss
border, the LHC accelerates two counter-rotating beams of protons to
$4 \tev$ each. The proton beams are steered with superconducting
magnets around an
evacuated ring that is 26.7 km in circumference~\cite{bib:Evans:2008zzb}. At several points along
the ring, the beams are steered and focused such that the constituent
protons collide with high probability at a center-of-mass energy of $8
\tev$. One such point is surrounded by the ATLAS detector, a
general-purpose detector designed to take a snapshot of the collision
remnants~\cite{bib:Aad:2008zzm}. In this chapter, the various subsystems of the ATLAS
detector are discussed, and in the following chapter, the
reconstruction of a $pp$ collision from the ATLAS readout channels is
considered.
