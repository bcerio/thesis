The signal process, VBF Higgs production in the \ww decay channel, is
modeled with \POWHEG interfaced to \PYTHIAns8 for the parton
shower, with \ctten as the PDF in both generators. The cross
section is computed at NLO in QCD and EW~\cite{Ciccolini:2007jr,Ciccolini:2007ec,Arnold:2008rz}, with approximate
NNLO QCD corrections~\cite{Bolzoni:2010xr}. The branching fraction for the \ww decay
is derived from the \hdecay
program~\cite{bib:Dittmaier:2011ti,bib:Dittmaier:2012vm,bib:Heinemeyer:2013tqa},
yielding $\sigma\cdot{\mathrm{Br}} = 0.036$~pb at $m_H = 125$~\gev, where the branching
fraction for \wwlnln~has been included. 

The ggF$+2$j process is simulated with \POWHEG interfaced with
\PYTHIAns8. The cross section is computed at NNLO in
QCD~\cite{Djouadi:1991tka,Dawson:1990zj,Spira:1995rr,Harlander:2002wh,Anastasiou:2002yz,Ravindran:2003um},
with NLO electroweak corrections~\cite{Aglietti:2004nj,Actis:2008ug}
and soft gluon resummations up to
next-to-next-to-leading-log (NNLL)~\cite{Catani:2003zt}, as recommended by
the LHC Higgs Cross Section Working
Group~\cite{bib:Dittmaier:2011ti,bib:Dittmaier:2012vm,bib:Heinemeyer:2013tqa}. The
branching fraction used in the normalization comes from
\hdecay~\cite{Djouadi:1997yw}, with the associated uncertainties
compiled
in~\cite{bib:Dittmaier:2011ti,bib:Dittmaier:2012vm}. Due
to known deficiencies in the Higgs $p_T$ spectrum in \POWHEG, the
Higgs $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ is re-weighted to the NLO + NNLL prediction
from \HqT~\cite{deFlorian:2011xf}. 

Top background is comprised mainly of \ttbar~(Figure), with smaller
contributions from $s$ and
$t$ channel single top and $Wt$. The
parton level process for \ttbar~is simulated in \POWHEG at NLO in QCD,
while \PYTHIAns 6 is used for parton showering and
hadronization. The LO PDF set CTEQ6L1 is used with \PERUGIA 2011 as
the underlying event tune. For ST,
$s$ channel and $Wt$ use \POWHEGns +\PYTHIAns 6 as well, while
\textsc{AcerMC}+\PYTHIAns 6 is used to model $t$-channel ST. The same
PDF and UE tune is used for all top processes.

The \ttbar~normalization is scaled to the cross section for $pp$
collisions at \sqrts~$=8$~\tev~for a top quark mass of
$172.5 \gev/c^2$, $\sigma_{t\bar{t}}=252.9^{+15.3}_{-16.3}$~pb. This
value has been
calculated at NNLO in QCD including a resummation of NNLL soft gluon
terms~\cite{bib:Cacciari:2011hy,bib:Beneke:2011mq,bib:Baernreuther:2012ws,bib:Czakon:2012zr,bib:Czakon:2012pz,bib:Czakon:2013goa,bib:Czakon:2011xx}.
The total cross section for \ttbar~has been measured in ATLAS to be
$237.7\pm11.3$~pb in the leptonic decay channel with one
electron and one muon in the final
state~\cite{bib:ttbar_cross_section}, agreeing with the
theory calculation within the QCD scale uncertainties. The $s$ channel
ST, $t$ channel ST, and $Wt$ normalizations are also scaled to the
NNLO and NNLL cross sections of
$5.61\pm0.22$~pb~\cite{bib:Kidonakis:2010tc},
$87.76^{+3.44}_{-1.91}$~pb~\cite{bib:Kidonakis:2011wy}, and
$22.37\pm1.52$~pb~\cite{bib:Kidonakis:2010ux}, respectively. These
computations are compatible with the respective measurements in
ATLAS~\cite{bib:tchan_cross_section,bib:Wt_cross_section}.

The QCD \ww prediction is from \SHERPA 1.4.1, which is used to
simulate the
hard-scatter, parton shower, and hadronization for all
$q\bar{q}/qg/\bar{q}g\rightarrow{WW}$ diagrams. Events are generated
at LO in QCD with up to three jets at matrix element level, and the
$W$ bosons are
forced to decay leptonically. The overall normalization is
scaled to the total \ww cross section at \sqrts$=8$~\tev, as computed
in \MCFM: $\sigma_{tot}(\wwlnln) = 5.679$~pb. Given that the branching
fraction of $W\rightarrow{\ell\nu}$ is 0.1082 and there are nine
lepton combinations, the corresponding total cross section is
$\sigma_{tot}(\ww) = 53.90$~pb. The total \ww cross section has been
measured in ATLAS in the \ww leptonic decay channels and the exclusive
zero jet
bin~\cite{bib:ww_cross_section}. The result, which includes
resonant \ww production from $H$, is
$\sigma_{tot}(WW) = 71.4^{+1.2}_{-1.2} \textrm{(stat)} ^{+5.0}_{-4.4}
\textrm{(syst)}^{+2.2}_{-2.1}\textrm{(lumi)}$~pb, significantly larger
than the \MCFM computation which includes $H$, $\sigma_{MCFM}(WW) =
58.7^{+3.0}_{-2.7}$~pb. However, the ATLAS measurement is done in a
phase space
region that is orthogonal to this analysis, and in fact, the \MCFM
calculation does not include diagrams with two partons in the final
state. The normalization in the 2j bin relies on the LO jet
multiplicity prediction
from \SHERPA.

The EW \ww processes are also simulated with \SHERPA with exactly two
jets in the hard scatter. The LO cross section for EW \ww with the
$W$s decaying to leptons, computed in \SHERPA, is $\sigma(\wwlnln) =
39.68$~fb. Events with Higgs couplings are not simulated; instead, the
interference between Higgs and \ww processes is assessed as a
uncertainty on the cross section.
