\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:introduction}

The Standard Model has been immensely successful at describing
experimental results in particle physics.
The recent discovery of the Higgs boson was the latest observation to
confirm what it had predicted well in advance.

However, the Standard Model is known to be an incomplete description
of nature.
Colliders such as the Tevatron and the Large Hadron Collider
have been assembled to test the Standard Model at high energy scales
in search of discrepancies between its predictions and experimental
observation.
Although no significant deviations between the two have yet been
exposed in the realm of particle physics, dark matter, gravity, and
the hierarchy problem all hint that there is a more fundamental
theory waiting to be uncovered.

The top quark is peculiar among the fermions in that its mass is on
the order of the weak energy scale.
This not only makes it an interesting subject of study in and of
itself, it suggests that it may have a larger role to play than it
has been given in the Standard Model.
In this thesis a search for the resonant production of top quark pairs
beyond the Standard Model in proton-proton collisions is presented.
Collision data were collected from the Large Hadron Collider with the
ATLAS detector, and the subsequent analysis and interpretation of
these data are presented herein.

The document is organized as follows.
Chapter 2 introduces the Standard Model (SM) as well as extensions to
the Standard Model that are tested in this thesis.
The physics of proton collisions and the production of top quark pairs
at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) are also discussed.
Chapter 3 describes the two primary components of the experimental
setup: the LHC and the ATLAS detector.
The ATLAS subdetectors are discussed in detail.
Monte Carlo (MC) techniques are employed to simulate LHC proton
collisions and the interactions of the resulting particles with the
experimental apparatus.
This is described in Chapter 4.
The reconstruction of particles traversing ATLAS is discussed in
Chapter 5.
The focus of this thesis is Chapter 6, in which a search for
resonant top pair production beyond the Standard Model (BSM) is
presented: the analysis strategy, estimation of the background
processes, uncertainties in the measurement, and final results.
Chapter 7 describes techniques developed for the reconstruction of
energetic top quarks.
Finally, Chapter 8 details studies of the expected ATLAS sensitivity
to BSM physics under the High Luminosity LHC upgrade scenario.
