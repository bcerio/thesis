\chapter{Theoretical Background}
\label{chap:theory}

Evolving over the course of decades of theoretical insights and
experimental discoveries, the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics
can be viewed as a success of the scientific method. In its current
incarnation, the SM describes three of the four elementary particle
interactions, predicting with surprising accuracy the spectrum of
these particles and the strengths with which they interact. These
predictions-- governing interactions within dying stars, nuclear
reactors, and in the universe immediately after its birth--- are
derived from fundamental symmetries known to exist in nature. In this
chapter, the theoretical framework for the Higgs boson measurement
presented in this thesis is laid out, starting with a description of
the SM. From there, an application of the SM to physics in hadron
colliders is discussed, and the chapter
concludes with a look at the nature of the Higgs boson at the Large
Hadron Collider.
