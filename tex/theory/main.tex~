\chapter{Theoretical Background}
\label{chap:theory}

This chapter gives a brief introduction to the Standard Model, models
beyond the Standard Model relevant to this thesis, and the physics of
proton collisions.

\section{The Standard Model}

The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics is the most widely
accepted theory for predicting the interactions of elementary
particles.
It describes all known fundamental particles and the strong and
electroweak forces.

\subsection{Particles and interactions}
Particles in the SM are split into two categories: fermions with
half-integer spin and bosons with integer spin.
The fermions are further divided into those that have color and
interact via the strong force (quarks), and those that do not
(leptons).
There are three generations of both quarks and leptons which are
generally grouped in order of increasing mass.
This is shown in Table~\ref{chap:theory:tab:smfermions}.
Quarks have non-integer charge and are grouped into ``up-type'' ($u$,
$c$, $t$, with charge $+2/3$) and ``down-type'' ($d$, $s$, $b$, with
charge $-1/3$) varieties.
Leptons are grouped by their charges: electrons ($e$), muons
($\mu$), and tau leptons ($\tau$) carry negative charge, and there is
a corresponding chargeless neutrino ($\nu_\ell$) for each charged
lepton.
Antiparticles have identical masses but opposite charges.
The fermion type is sometimes referred to as its flavor.

There are four vector bosons in the Standard Model which mediate
interactions between particles.
Gluons ($g$) interact with quarks and other gluons through the strong
force described by quantum chromodynamics (QCD); they are massless.
Photons ($\gamma$) and the massive weak bosons ($W^\pm$, $Z$) mediate
the electroweak interaction, a unification of the electromagnetic
and weak theories by Glashow, Salam, and Weinberg~\cite{bib:glashow,
bib:weinberg, bib:salam}.
The $W$ and $Z$ bosons interact with all fermion flavors and each
other.
Photons are massless and only couple the charged fermions and the $W$
boson.

The Higgs boson, which was the last predicted SM particle that had not
been confirmed, was recently observed by experiments using collision
data from the Large Hadron Collider
(LHC)~\cite{bib:atlashiggs,bib:cmshiggs}.
In the SM, interactions with the Higgs field are responsible for the masses of
quarks, charged leptons, and the $W$ and $Z$ bosons.

\subsection{Quantum chromodynamics}

Quantum chromodynamics describes the interactions of particles with a
color quantum number: the quarks and gluons.
Its dynamics are determined by the SU(3) gauge symmetry group.
Quarks and gluons have never been observed as free particles; rather,
they hadronize into mesons and baryons on the timescale
$1/\Lambda_{QCD}$, where $\Lambda_{QCD} \sim 200$~MeV is the QCD
scale.
All mesons and baryons (or, collectively, hadrons) are color singlet.

The strength of QCD interactions is dictated by the strong coupling,
$\alpha_S$, which runs with the square of the momentum transfer,
$Q^2$, between interacting particles.
For interactions with a low momentum transfer $\alpha_S$ is large, and
QCD predictions are difficult to calculate due to the non-perturbative
nature of the interaction.
At high momentum transfer, however, $\alpha_S$ is sufficiently small for
the computation of rigorous perturbative predictions.
The coupling $\alpha_S$ diverges in perturbation theory at
$\Lambda_{QCD}$.

\subsection{Electroweak interactions}

The Standard Model electroweak theory is governed by the
SU(2)$_L \times$U(1) symmetry groups that characterize the
interactions of the electroweak vector bosons with quarks and
leptons.
The generators of these groups are the weak isospin, $T$, and the
hypercharge, $Y = 2(Q-T_3)$, where $Q$ is the electric charge and
$T_3$ is the third component of the weak isospin operator.
$g_1$ and $g_2$ are the couplings corresponding to the U(1) and
SU(2)$_L$ symmetry groups.

The physical gauge boson fields can be written in terms of the pure
SU(2)$_L$ and U(1) bosons, $W^i_\mu$ and $B_\mu$:

\begin{align}
      A_\mu & = B_\mu \cos\theta_W + W_\mu^3 \sin\theta_W \\
    W^+_\mu & = \frac{1}{\sqrt 2} (W^1_\mu - iW_\mu^2) \\
    W^-_\mu & = \frac{1}{\sqrt 2} (W^1_\mu + iW_\mu^2) \\
      Z_\mu & = - B_\mu \sin\theta_W + W_\mu^3 \cos\theta_W
\end{align}

\noindent where $A_\mu$ is the photon field, $W^\pm_\mu$ are the $W$
boson fields, $Z_\mu$ is the $Z$ boson field, and
$\theta_W = \arctan(g_1/g_2) = \arccos(m_W/m_Z)$ is the weak mixing
angle.
Since the SU(2)$_L$ symmetry only applies to left-handed fermions,
right-handed fermions do not interact with the $W$ bosons and only
interact with the $Z$ boson through the original U(1) $B_\mu$ boson.

The Higgs mechanism describes the process of electroweak symmetry
breaking (EWSB), by which the $W$ and $Z$ bosons acquire mass.
As a direct result, the Higgs boson emerges as an excitation above its
vacuum expectation value, $v$.
A summary of the fermion Yukawa couplings, $y_f$, to the Higgs is
shown in Figure~\ref{chap:theory:fig:fermmass}~\cite{bib:fermmass}.
Fermion masses are defined in terms of the Yukawa couplings as

\begin{equation}
    m_f = \frac{v}{\sqrt{2}} y_f.
\end{equation}

\section{Models with \ttbar\ resonances}
\label{chap:theory:sec:models_with_ttbar_resonances}

Although the Standard Model has been very successful at predicting and
describing recent experimental results in particle physics, it does
not explain all known physical phenomena.
The gravitational force is yet to be successfully integrated into
the framework of quantum field theory (QFT), and dark matter, dark
energy, the asymmetry between matter and antimatter, and the
discrepancy between the electroweak ($\sim1$~TeV) and Planck
($\sim10^{16}$~TeV) scales (the hierarchy problem) all pose questions
that the Standard Model cannot answer at present.

Numerous models which tackle one or more of these issues have been
developed, and a subset of these predict significant deviations from
the Standard Model at the TeV scale.
Colliders such as the Tevatron and the LHC and their associated
detectors aim to carefully probe the predictions of new models by
producing very energetic particle interactions.
Two such models that are used as benchmarks in the \ttbar\ resonances
search presented in Chapter~\ref{chap:ttbarres} are introduced in the
following sections.

\subsection{Massive $Z^\prime$ boson through topcolor assisted
technicolor}
\label{chap:theory:sec:zprimetheory}

The top quark's large mass suggests that it may play a role in the
mechanism for electroweak symmetry breaking.
Topcolor assisted technicolor models generate EWSB through the
formation of a condensate of top
quarks~\cite{bib:topcolor,bib:topcolor1,bib:topcolor2}.

In these models, there are two SU(3) gauge symmetry groups, one which
couples preferentially, for example, to the first- and
second-generation quarks (SU(3)$_1$), and one preferentially to the
third (SU(3)$_2$).
These symmetries are broken to yield the SU(3)$_{QCD}$ gauge symmetry of the
strong interaction: SU(3)$_{1} \times$SU(3)$_2 \to$SU(3)$_{QCD}$.

However, this formulation predicts degenerate masses of the top and
bottom quarks at approximately 600~GeV~\cite{bib:topcolor3}.
Various corrective methods have been implemented to break the
mass degeneracy and reduce the top mass to its observed value.
The salient feature of each of them is the introduction of, and
subsequent breaking of, additional U(1) gauge symmetry groups.
These new symmetry groups, U(1)$_1$ and U(1)$_2$, also couple
preferentially to the first two generations and the third generation,
respectively, and are broken to yield the U(1) gauge symmetry of the
Standard Model: U(1)$_1 \times$U(1)$_2 \to$U(1)$_{Y}$.
This gives rise to a new massive vector boson that, in order to break
the degeneracy of the top and bottom quarks with the appropriate mass
hierarchy, results in an attractive force for \ttbar\ condensates and
a repulsive one for $b\bar b$ condensates.
Due to its similarities with the SM $Z$ boson---it is a neutral,
massive vector boson---it is referred to as a \zp\ boson.

There is some freedom in the model: the pairing of generations in the
symmetry groups is arbitrary.
The combination with the most enhanced production cross sections at a
proton collider makes the first and third generations couple strongly
to the first SU(3)$_1 \times$U(1)$_1$, while the second generation of
quarks to the second set of symmetry groups.
This is named Model IV in Ref.~\cite{bib:topcolor4}.

The width of the new \zp\ boson is also a free parameter in the model.
Figure~\ref{chap:theory:fig:zpxsecs} shows the cross section times
branching ratio of the topcolor $Z^\prime$ boson decaying to \ttbar\
pairs for $\sqrt{s} = 8$~TeV proton-proton collisions.

        boson~\cite{bib:topcolor3}.
    }

\end{figure}

\subsection{Kaluza-Klein gluon excitation in Randall-Sundrum models}
\label{chap:theory:sec:kkgtheory}

In the Standard Model, particle fields are confined to the
conventional four dimensions of space-time.
However, the possibility of small, compact additional spatial
dimensions has not been ruled out by current experiments.
The momentum of a particle propagating in an extra dimension will
manifest itself as apparent additional mass, and the mass spectrum
will be discrete if the dimension is compact.
These discrete modes are called Kaluza-Klein
excitations~\cite{bib:kaluza, bib:klein}.

Randall-Sundrum (RS) models address the hierarchy problem through the
introduction of warped extra dimensions~\cite{bib:rs}.
The extra dimension, or ``bulk,'' connects the usual TeV scale
space-time, the infrared (IR) ``brane,'' with the observed spectrum
of particle masses to a Planck scale UV brane, on which the
gravitational and electroweak scales are unified.
The metric in this space is defined as

\begin{equation}
    ds^2 = e^{-2k|y|} \eta_{\mu\nu} dx^\mu dx^\nu - dy^2,
\end{equation}

\noindent where $k$ is the curvature of the warped extra dimension, 
and $y$ is the coordinate in the extra dimension.
$y = 0$ is defined as the location of the UV brane, and the IR brane
is at $y = r$.

Due to the exponential dependence of the metric on $y$, masses on the
TeV scale brane, $m$, are related to the more fundamental masses on
the Planck scale brane, $m_0$, by 

\begin{equation}
    m = e^{-kr\pi} m_{0}.
\end{equation}

\noindent Standard model particles are mostly localized close to the
UV brane to account for their small masses; the top quark is
accordingly farthest from $y=0$.

The first indication that such an extra dimension exists will likely
be through observation of the Kaluza-Klein excitation of Standard
Model fields in the bulk.
At the LHC, the production of high-energy gluons makes the bulk
excitation of the gluon (\kkg) have a relatively higher cross section
than other excitations.
Since the gluon excitation is localized near the IR brane, the wave
function overlap between the \kkg\ and the top quark is much higher
than its overlap with other particles.
Therefore, the dominant decay mode of the Kaluza-Klein gluon in this
particular model is to \ttbar\ pairs, provided the mass of the first
excitation is at least twice $m_{top}$.

Figure~\ref{chap:theory:fig:kkgxsecs} shows the total production cross
section of Kaluza-Klein gluons and their branching ratios for this
model as a function of the apparent mass of the excitation.

\section{The physics of proton collisions}

Protons are composite particles, made up of constituent quarks and
gluons which, at sufficient momentum transfer, individually undergo
interactions with other particles.
In proton collisions these interactions are described chiefly by
quantum chromodynamics.


\subsection{Low-$Q^2$ QCD at the LHC}

Although the LHC was designed to probe physics at center-of-mass
energies well above $\sim 10$~GeV, most proton collisions at the LHC
involve momentum exchange that is below this scale.
When low-energy collisions take place simultaneously with the
high-energy collisions, their effect on the reconstruction of the
high-energy collision must be taken into account.
These simultaneous collisions are known as pile-up events, and their
cross sections and kinematics are calculated using models implemented
with Monte Carlo techniques~\cite{bib:pileupevents}.


\subsection{Hard scatter events}

At high momentum transfer, the collision of two protons can be treated
as a direct interaction between their constituent quarks and gluons
(partons).
To model this correctly, the internal structure of the proton must be
understood.

This is chiefly accomplished through the deep inelastic scattering
(DIS) of a lepton and a proton.
In DIS experiments, a lepton interacts directly with a parton inside
the proton; the interaction cross section and scattered lepton
kinematics as a function of the momentum transferred are sensitive to
the proton's structure.
The data from $ep$ experiments (e.g.\ ZEUS and H1 at
HERA~\cite{bib:hera}), $\mu p$ experiments (BCDMS~\cite{bib:bcdms},
E665~\cite{bib:E665}), and $\nu p$ experiments
(CHORUS~\cite{bib:chorus}, NuTeV~\cite{bib:nutev}), are used to
derive parton distribution functions (PDFs).
PDFs describe the probability of a parton of a certain flavor to carry
the fractional momentum, $x$, of the proton at a momentum transfer
$Q^2$.

Results from fixed target experiments, lepton-proton colliders, and
hadron colliders (primarily for high-$Q^2$) are combined and fit to
obtain an accurate representation of the proton structure over a range
of $x$ and $Q^2$.
Figure~\ref{chap:theory:fig:pdfs} shows the \mstw NNLO
PDFs~\cite{bib:mstw} at two exemplary energy scales.

        10,000~GeV$^2$ (right)~\cite{bib:pdg}.
}
\label{chap:theory:fig:pdfs}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Top quark pair production and decays}

High-$Q^2$ collisions at the LHC produce a variety of final state
particles at different rates.
Figure~\ref{chap:theory:fig:smprocs} summarizes the cross sections of
a selection of the SM processes as a function of the center-of-mass
energy of the collision.

        collisions as a function of the proton-proton center-of-mass
        energy~\cite{bib:collphenom}.
    Processes whose production is dominated by QCD interactions are
    colored red or blue.
    Electroweak processes are green and magenta.
}
\label{chap:theory:fig:smprocs}
\end{figure}

At leading order there are two primary production processes for
\ttbar\ pairs: quark-antiquark annihilation and the fusion of two
gluons.
Gluon-gluon fusion accounts for about 80\% of the \ttbar\ production
cross section at the LHC\@.
The diagrams corresponding to these processes are shown in
Figure~\ref{chap:theory:fig:ttbardiagrams}.
The total \ttbar\ cross section with $\sqrts = 8$~TeV proton-proton
collisions is $238.1^{+23.3}_{-25.2}$~pb at next-to-next-to leading
order according to HATHOR~\cite{bib:hathor}.

The mass of the top quark as measured by the Tevatron experiments is
$173.20\pm0.87$~GeV~\cite{bib:mtop}, and its lifetime is on the order
of $10^{-24}$~s.
Since its lifetime is smaller than the QCD timescale,
$1/\Lambda_{QCD}$, the top quark does not hadronize, but immediately
decays to a $W$ boson and a $b$ quark with a branching fraction of
greater than 99.9\%.
Because of this, the top quark decay mode is almost entirely dependent
on the decay of its $W$ boson daughter.

$W$ bosons decay approximately 10\% of the time to each charged lepton
and its corresponding neutrino.
The other 70\% of $W$ decays result in a quark and antiquark of
different flavors.
Given the $W$ boson decay modes, about 44\% of \ttbar\ pairs result in
the production of exactly one lepton.
Figure~\ref{chap:theory:fig:ttbardecaychannels} illustrates the
\ttbar\ decay modes pictorially.

\begin{figure}[h]

    \includegraphics[width=0.90\textwidth]{theory/ttbardiagrams.png}

        to produce \ttbar\ pairs.
        The other three plots, from left to right, show $s$-, $t$-,
        and $u$-channel \ttbar\ production from the fusion of two
        gluons.

    respectively.}
\label{chap:theory:fig:ttbardecaychannels}
\end{figure}


\ttbar\ events are therefore characterized by the production of two
high-$p_T$ $b$ quarks and two $W$ bosons.
The analysis presented in Chapter~\ref{chap:ttbarres} reconstructs
\ttbar\ pairs in the single lepton channel, in which one $W$ boson
decays to a charged lepton and a neutrino and the other to two quarks.

Since the initial state particles in proton collisions are quarks and
gluons, leptons and neutrinos are only created through electroweak
processes at the LHC\@.
The dominant non-\ttbar\ background process which mimics \ttbar\
events in the single lepton channel is \wjets\ production, wherein the
$W$ boson decays leptonically.
Although the $\wjets\to\ell\nu+$jets cross section is larger than that of
\ttbar\ at the LHC, additionally searching for a final state
consistent with 4 quarks, two of them being high-$p_T$ $b$ quarks,
reduces the \wjets\ background significantly.

\subsection{Other relevant processes in the single lepton channel}

Lepton production can occur from the prompt decays of heavy bosons, as
takes place in the top quark decay chain, or through non-prompt
processes, such as photon conversions, Dalitz decays, and the weak
decays of heavy flavor (usually $b$ or $c$) quarks.
