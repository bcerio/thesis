\subsection{Preselection}

With the physics objects defined, a series of preselection cuts
designed to isolate the $\ell\nu\ell\nu$ final state is applied. These
cuts are applied in both the VBF analysis and the other jet
bins. First, exactly two leptons with opposite charge are required,
with the leading lepton \pt$>22$~\gev and the subleading lepton
\pt$>10$~\gev. These cuts have been optimized to maximize signal
acceptance, while minimizing contamination from background due to jets
faking leptons which grow at low \pt. A dilepton mass cut of
\mll$>$~10 (12)~\gev is applied in the \emme (\eemm) lepton channel,
and to reject background from \ZDY, events with dilepton mass falling
in within 15~\gev~of the Z pole mass are cut away. Lepton and jet
kinematic distributions are shown in figures XX and XX, and both calo
and track \etmiss are shown in figure XX. The MC models the data
adequately in this phase space region.
