Top background is comprised mainly of \ttbar~(Figure), with $s$ and $t$
channel single top and $Wt$ contributions as well (denoted ST). The parton
level process for \ttbar~is simulated in
\POWHEG at NLO, while \PYTHIAns 6 is used for parton showering and
hadronization. The LO PDF set CTEQ6L1 is used with \PERUGIA 2011 as
the underlying event tune. Past iterations of the VBF analysis in this
decay channel used \MCATNLO to model
\ttbar~\cite{bib:hww_moriond_2013}, but \POWHEGns +\PYTHIA models jet
kinematic distributions better in the VBF phase space region. However, leptons generated in
\MCATNLO model the data better than \POWHEG. To account for these
modelling differences, we assign theoretical uncertainties. For ST,
$s$ channel and $Wt$ use \POWHEGns +\PYTHIAns 6 as well, while
\textsc{AcerMC}+\PYTHIAns 6 is used to model $t$-channel ST. The same PDF
and UE tune is used for all top estimates. 

The \ttbar~normalization is scaled to the cross section for $pp$
collisions at \sqrts$=8$ \tev for a top quark mass of $172.5 \gev/c^2$,
which is $\sigma_{t\bar{t}}=252.89$~pb. This value has been
calculated at NNLO in QCD including a resummation of
next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (NNLL) soft gluon
terms~\cite{bib:Cacciari:2011hy,bib:Beneke:2011mq,bib:Baernreuther:2012ws,bib:Czakon:2012zr,bib:Czakon:2012pz,bib:Czakon:2013goa,bib:Czakon:2011xx}.
The total cross section for \ttbar~ has been measured to be
$237.7\pm11.3$~pb in the purely leptonic decay channel with one
electron and one muon in the final
state~\cite{bib:ttbar_cross_section}, agreeing quite well with the
theory calculation. The $s$ channel ST, $t$ channel ST, and $Wt$ normalizations are also scaled to the
NNLO and NNLL cross sections of $5.61\pm0.22$~pb~\cite{bib:Kidonakis:2010tc},
$87.76^{+3.44}_{-1.91}$~pb~\cite{bib:Kidonakis:2011wy}, and
$22.37\pm1.52$~pb~\cite{bib:Kidonakis:2010ux}, respectively. These
computations are also compatible with the respective measurements in
ATLAS~\cite{bib:tchan_cross_section,bib:Wt_cross_section}.



These processes contain at least one heavy flavor quark. Therefore, they can
be efficiently suppressed by requiring that the number of $b$ tags in
the event is zero.
