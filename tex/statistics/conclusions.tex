At the measured Higgs boson mass of $125.36 \gev$, evidence
for vector boson fusion Higgs production has been observed in the
\hwwlnln channel at a significance of $3.2\sigma$. The expected
significance at this $m_H$ is $2.7\sigma$, indicating that the observed
excess is within $1\sigma$ of the SM expectation for VBF production. A rigorous analysis
optimization--- most importantly, the use of a boosted decision
tree--- has produced an expected sensitivity improvement of 70\% with
respect to the last published VBF result in this channel on the same
dataset~\cite{bib:hww_moriond_2013}. The signal strength for VBF Higgs
production has been measured to be $1.27^{+0.53}_{-0.45}$,
corresponding to an inclusive
$\sigma_{\textrm{VBF}}^{8 \tev}\cdot\mathscr{B}_{\hww}$ of
$0.51^{+0.22}_{-0.17}$~pb. This measurement is in agreement with the
SM prediction of $0.34$~pb.
