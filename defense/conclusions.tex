    \frametitle{Conclusions}

    \begin{itemize}
    \item A search for the resonant production of \ttbar\ pairs has
        been performed at the LHC with 14.3~\ifb\ of $\sqrts = 8$~TeV
        proton-proton collisions and the ATLAS detector.
    \item No significant deviation from the Standard Model is
        observed.
    \item Upper cross section limits at 95\% credibility for two
        signal benchmark models were set:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Kaluza-Klein gluon ($\kkg$) in RS models excluded for
        $0.5~{\rm TeV} < m_{\kkg} < 2.0$~TeV\@;
    \item Leptophobic $Z^\prime$ boson in Topcolor Assisted
        Technicolor excluded for $0.5~{\rm TeV} < m_{\zp} < 1.8$~TeV.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}
    \item Significant selection efficiency improvements in the
        electron channel have been recently achieved and will be
        included in the forthcoming ATLAS \ttbar\ resonances paper.
    \item Expected sensitivity to exotic physics with an upgraded LHC
        and ATLAS detector has also been studied.
\end{itemize}
