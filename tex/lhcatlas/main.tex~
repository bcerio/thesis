\section{The Large Hadron Collider}
\label{chap:lhcatlas:sec:lhc}

The Large Hadron Collider accelerates two beams of protons to 4~TeV
each, producing collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 8~TeV.
Its single-beam energy is expected to reach 6.5~TeV in 2015 operations.
The LHC is located at the European Council for Nuclear Research
(CERN) campus, near Geneva, Switzerland, and its beamline ring is
27~km in circumference and buried between 50 and 175~m under parts of
both Switzerland and France.

Protons are initially accelerated linearly by the Linac 2, then are
ramped up in energy by the Proton Synchrotron Booster, the Proton
Synchrotron, and the Super Proton Synchrotron, and finally are
deposited into the main LHC beam pipes.
Superconducting dipole and quadrupole magnets respectively bend and
focus the beams.
Protons move in bunches around the ring, and each bunch is about
30~cm long; almost 3000 bunches can travel around the ring at a given
time.

The two beams circulate counter to each other and are crossed at four
interaction points where collisions occur.
In 2012 data taking, an average of approximately 20 proton-proton
interactions took place for each pair of bunches that crossed at these
locations.
Four primary detectors are arrayed around the ring at the interaction
points.
Two of these, ATLAS and the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS), are
general-purpose detectors capable of probing a wide variety of physics
processes.
The data presented in this thesis were collected with the ATLAS
detector, which is discussed in detail below.


\section{The ATLAS Detector}

The ATLAS (A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS) detector measures properties of
final state particles created by the LHC's proton-proton
collisions~\cite{bib:ATLASAtTheLHC}.
A schematic of the detector is shown in Figure~\ref{chap:lhcatlas:fig:atlas}.
The ATLAS coordinate system, its three major sub-detectors (the inner
detector, calorimeters, and muon system), and the trigger system are
described in this chapter.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Coordinate system}
\label{chap:lhcatlas:sec:coordsys}

ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with the origin defined by
the location of the nominal interaction point.
The $z$-axis is aligned with the beam, the positive $x$-axis points
from the interaction point to the center of the LHC ring, and the
positive $y$-direction is defined upwards.
The azimuthal angle, $\phi$, is measured from the positive $x$-axis
around the beam, with the positive $y$-axis at $\phi = \pi/2$;\@ the
radial distance is given by $R = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$.
The polar angle, $\theta$, is measured from the positive $z$-axis with
the $x$-$y$ plane at $\theta = \pi/2$.
The rapidity, $\xi = \ln \sqrt{(E + p_z)/(E - p_z)}$, is a convenient
angular coordinate because differences in $\xi$ are Lorentz invariant
under boosts along the beam axis.
For massless particles, this reduces to the pseudorapidity,
$\eta = -\ln \tan(\theta/2) = \ln \sqrt{(|{\mathbf p}| +
    p_z)/(|{\mathbf p}| - p_z)}$.
The angular distance measure
$\dr = \sqrt{\Delta \eta^2 + \Delta \phi^2}$ is similarly invariant.

The detector is split into three regions: one central 
barrel region ($|\eta| < 1.5$) and two forward ($|\eta| > 1.5$)
end-cap regions.
Transverse quantities, e.g.\ the transverse momentum $p_T$ and
transverse energy $E_T$, incorporate only vector components projected
onto the $x$-$y$ plane unless stated otherwise.


\subsection{Inner detector}
\label{chap:lhcatlas:sec:innerdetector}

The ATLAS inner detector (ID) tracks charged particles as they leave
the interaction vertex.
It is made up of three subsystems: the Pixel Detector (pixels),
the Semiconductor Tracker (SCT), and the Transition
Radiation Tracker (TRT).
Figures~\ref{chap:lhcatlas:fig:innerdetbarrel}
and~\ref{chap:lhcatlas:fig:innerdetendcap} show schematics of the inner
detector barrel and end-cap regions, respectively.

    track traversing the inner detector subsystems

}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


The entire inner detector is surrounded by a large solenoid magnet
which induces a nearly-constant 2 Tesla magnetic field in the $z$
direction.
The transverse momentum of a charged particle traversing the inner
detector is directly proportional to the radius of curvature of its
track.

\subsubsection{The pixel detector and silicon tracker}
%% TODO
%% change to $R\phi$

The pixel subsystem is closest to the beam pipe and is composed  of
three layers of silicon, each pixel measuring approximately 50
$\mu$m $\times$ 400 $\mu$m in the $R$-$\phi$ and $z$ directions,
respectively.
There are more than 80 million readout channels, one for each pixel.
In the central region of the detector, the pixels form concentric
cylinders around the beam pipe;\@ they are arranged in disks
perpendicular to the beam in the end-cap regions.
Due to its granularity, very precise position measurements are
possible, with an intrinsic resolution of 10~$\mu$m in the $\phi$
direction and 115~$\mu$m in the $z$ ($R$) direction in the barrel
(end-cap).
The first pixel layer is about 50~mm  from the center of the beam
pipe.
Its proximity to the interaction point is especially useful for
differentiating tracks which originate at the primary interaction
from decays-in-flight.

The SCT surrounds the pixel detector and is comprised of about 6
million channels read out from strips of silicon.
There are four double-layers of strips, allowing for a possible eight
crossings by each track.
The closest of these layers is approximately 300~mm from the beam.
The intrinsic resolution of each strip detector is 17~$\mu$m in $\phi$
and 580~$\mu$m in $z$ ($R$) in the barrel (end-cap).

\subsubsection{Transition radiation tracker}
The TRT is the largest inner detector subsystem, filling the space
between 0.5~m and 1.0~m from the beam out to $|\eta| = 2.0$.
It is made of long 4 mm-diameter straws filled with a mixture of
Xe (70\%), CO$_2$ (27\%), and O$_2$ (3\%) gas.
The TRT is divided into four sections: two in the barrel region
separated by the $z = 0$ plane and one in each end-cap.
Straws are oriented parallel to the beam in the barrel and arrayed
radially outward in the end-caps.
Beyond this course segmentation in $z$, only $R$-$\phi$ information
is available for each hit in the TRT;\@ the intrinsic $R$-$\phi$
resolution per straw is 130 $\mu$m.

As a charged particle moves through a TRT straw it ionizes the
enclosed gas.
The resulting free electrons drift to the central anode wire, further
ionizing the gas as they do so.
Drifting ions induce a current on it which is subsequently read out.
Thin layers of polypropylene foam fill the space between TRT straws to
produce transition radiation, causing photons to be emitted as charged
particles cross the boundary between materials with different indices
of refraction.
The amount of radiation emitted at the material interfaces grows with
the $\gamma$-factor of the charged particle.


\subsection{Calorimeters}
\label{chap:lhcatlas:sec:calos}

The ATLAS detector has two calorimeter subsystems: the electromagnetic
(EM) calorimeter and the hadronic calorimeters (HCAL).
Their coverage reaches to $|\eta| = 4.9$, and their design is
complementary to that of the inner detector for the purpose of
precision electron, photon, jet, and \met\ measurements.
It is important that electromagnetic and hadronic showers are
fully-contained by the respective calorimeter for accurate particle
reconstruction and to prevent punch-through into the muon system.
The calorimeters are a total of 11 interaction lengths ($\lambda$)
thick at $\eta = 0$, which allows them to adequately perform in both
respects.

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{lhcatlas/calorimeters.eps}
\caption[Schematic of the ATLAS calorimeters]
{Schematic of the ATLAS calorimeters
\label{chap:lhcatlas:fig:calorimeters}
}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Electromagnetic Calorimeter}
The EM calorimeter is sectioned into one barrel ($|\eta| < 1.475$) and
two end-cap ($1.375 < |\eta| < 3.2$) regions.
It is made up of alternating absorbing (lead) and active (liquid
argon) layers arranged in an accordion pattern as shown in
Figure~\ref{chap:lhcatlas:fig:accordion}.
This layout provides uniform resolution in $\phi$ while avoiding
cracks in coverage due to electronics and other services.
In total, the EM calorimeter is approximately 22 radiation lengths
($X_0$) thick in the barrel and more than 24 $X_0$ in the end-caps.


\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{lhcatlas/accordion.eps}
\caption[Schematic of the electromagnetic calorimeter accordion
structure]
{Schematic of the electromagnetic calorimeter accordion

}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


There are three active layers for $0 < |\eta| < 2.5$ (the precision
measurement region) and two at higher eta, $2.5 < |\eta| < 3.2$.
Corrections for electron and photon energy losses in the inner
detector are made using a liquid argon presampling layer out to
$|\eta| = 1.8$.

In order to achieve good angular resolution, the closest layer to the
inner detector is finely granulated, particularly in $\eta$ ($\Delta
\eta \times \Delta \phi = 0.0031 \times 0.01$ for $|\eta| < 1.40$).
It is approximately 4 $X_0$ thick.
The primary sampling layer surrounds the first layer and, at 16
$X_0$ thick, absorbs most of the energy from the electromagnetic shower.
It is less finely segmented in $\eta$ than the first, but more so in
$\phi$ ($\Delta \eta \times \Delta \phi = 0.025 \times 0.025$ for
$|\eta| < 1.40$).
The third layer is more coarsely segmented ($\Delta \eta \times \Delta
\phi = 0.050 \times 0.025$), but provides further containment and
longitudinal shower shape information.

The design energy resolution of the EM calorimeter for electrons and
photons in both the barrel and end-caps is given by

\begin{equation}
\frac{\sigma_E}{E} = \frac{10\%}{\sqrt{E/\mathrm{GeV}}} \oplus 0.7\%.
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Hadronic calorimeters}

There are three ATLAS hadronic calorimeters: the tile calorimeter, the
hadronic end-cap calorimeter, and the forward calorimeter (FCal).

The tile calorimeter is made of steel as the absorber and
scintillating tiles as the active medium.
It is situated just outside the electromagnetic calorimeter
from a radius of 2.28~m to 4.25~m, or $7.4 \lambda$.
It has coverage out to $|\eta| = 1.7$ and is divided into a central
barrel ($|\eta| < 1.0$) and two forward extended barrels
($0.8 < |\eta| < 1.7$).
Each barrel contains 64 $\Delta \phi \approx 0.1$ wedges of steel and
scintillator.
The wedges are divided into three longitudinal layers of thickness
1.5, 4.1, and 1.8 $\lambda$ (1.5, 2.6, and 3.3 $\lambda$) in the
central (extended) barrel(s).

The hadronic end-cap calorimeter is a sampling calorimeter made of
copper and liquid argon and covers the eta range
$1.5 < |\eta| < 3.2$.
It is divided into two wheels (one front and one rear) in each
end-cap, each wheel consisting of two longitudinal sections, and each
section segmented into 32 wedge-shaped modules.
Readout cells vary in size depending on the $\eta$ range:
$\Delta \eta \times \Delta \phi = 0.1 \times 0.1$ for
$|\eta| < 2.5$ and $0.2 \times 0.2$ otherwise.

The FCal provides coverage over the eta range $3.1 < |\eta| < 4.9$ and
is segmented into three distinct layers: one with copper as the
absorber and two with tungsten; liquid argon is the sampling material
in each.
The copper/argon layer is located closest to the interaction point and
is optimized for detecting electromagnetic showers.
The second and third tungsten layers primarily measure hadronic
activity.


\subsection{Muon system}
\label{chap:lhcatlas:sec:muonsystem}

The outermost sub-detector of ATLAS is the muon system, which detects
and measures charged particles that leave the calorimeter systems out
to an $|\eta|$ of 2.7.
Precision tracking chambers and fast trigger chambers respectively
fulfill its primary purposes: to accurately measure and trigger on
high-momentum muons.

Muon trajectories are bent by large superconducting toroid magnets
located outside the hadronic calorimeter.
Central ($|\eta| < 1.4$) and forward ($1.6 < |\eta| < 2.7$) muons are
chiefly deflected by barrel and end-cap toroid magnets, respectively;
transition region ($1.4 < |\eta| < 1.6$) muons are deflected by
fields from both sets of magnets.
This geometry produces a magnetic field that is generally
perpendicular to the muon tracks, which is ideal for momentum
measurements.

Three layers of precision tracking chambers measure muon trajectories
across the covered $\eta$ range.
In the barrel region, monitored drift tube (MDT) chambers filled with
Ar and CO$_2$ gas are arranged in concentric cylinders surrounding
the beam.
Each chamber is composed of between three and eight layers of drift
tubes with an approximate spatial resolution of 35 $\mu$m per
chamber.
In the end-caps, the tracking chambers are laid out in disks
perpendicular to the beam.
MDTs make up all three layers out to $|\eta| = 2.0$.
Due to the higher particle flux in the forward region, cathode-strip
chambers (CSCs), which have significantly better time resolution than
MDTs, make up the first tracking layer for $|\eta| > 2.0$.

Complementary to the precision tracking chambers, fast trigger
chambers provide track information within tens of nanoseconds of a
particle traversal.
The central ($|\eta| < 1.05$) muon trigger system employs three layers
of resisitive plate chambers (RPCs) arranged in concentric cylinders,
each with the possibility of recording two hits per track, while
forward ($1.05 > |\eta| > 2.40$) muons pass through up to seven layers
of thin gap chambers (TGCs).
In addition to providing quick readout for trigger purposes,
track information from RPCs and TGCs is combined with that from the
precision tracking chambers to improve muon momentum measurements.

The total momentum resolution in the muon spectrometer is
approximately 10\% for 1~TeV muons, but accurate momentum and charge
measurements are possible over a wide range of muon energies, from
3~GeV to 3~TeV.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Trigger systems}
\label{chap:lhcatlas:sec:trigger}

The purpose of the ATLAS trigger system is to quickly identify
potentially interesting collision events delivered by the LHC\@.
The trigger is broken down into three progressively stricter selection
levels, Level-1 (L1), Level-2 (L2), and event filter (EF).
The L2 and EF triggers are known collectively as the high-level
triggers (HLT).

The L1 trigger identifies events with high-$p_T$ muons, electrons,
photons, jets, and $\tau$-leptons in addition to high \met\ in order
to reduce the event rate from that delivered by the LHC (40~MHz)
to about 75~kHz, taking less than 2.5~$\mu$s per decision.
It uses a subset of the available detectors to define these objects:
the muon trigger chambers and coarse-grained calorimeter information.
At L1, calorimeter energy deposits are summed over towers, which
incorporate all longitudinal cells in a given
$\Delta \eta \times \Delta \phi = 0.1 \times 0.1$ region, but
electromagnetic and hadronic towers are reported separately.
Regions of interest (RoIs) in $\eta$-$\phi$ space around objects
passing certain criteria (e.g.\ an energy threshold) are also
designated by the L1 trigger and passed to the HLT\@.

The high-level triggers filter events based on all detector data,
including tracking information, contained in the RoIs defined by
the L1 trigger.
Since the HLT operates at a lower event rate, particle, jet, and
\met\ definitions are refined using the additional detector
information available, and tighter requirements (e.g.\ higher
thresholds) are imposed on the objects in question.
For example, complete calorimeter granularity is available at HLT, so
jet and \met\ definitions are improved from L1.
A basic tracking algorithm is run on inner detector hit data at L2,
while at EF it is feasible to leverage the full offline tracking
machinery outlined in Section~\ref{chap:reconstruction:sec:tracking}.
Combined, the L2 and EF triggers reduce the event rate from 75~kHz to
approximately 200~Hz, and about 1~MB per selected event is stored to
disk.
