The work presented in this thesis would not have been possible without
the support of my friends, family, and colleagues.
I would first like to thank my Ph.D. advisor, Professor Ashutosh
Kotwal, for the guidance and freedom he has given me over the last
five years at Duke.
The feedback I received from the members of my committee, comprised of
Professors Arce, Chandrasekharan, Finkelstein, Mehen, and Wu, has also
been invaluable.


The members of Duke ATLAS group have been a pleasure to work with
since my arrival in Durham.
Professors Arce, Goshaw, and Kruse have always been willing to answer
my questions about not only physics, but also research funding, career
choices, and local food, beer, and chocolate.
My CERN roommates Andrea and Doug have my gratitude for their physics
and software discussions, not to mention their advice for adjusting to
life in France.
I am forever indebted to Miriam and Jenni, who always made certain I
never went into the red during my travels.
None of the research presented herein would be possible without the
generous support of the Department of Energy Office of Science for the
ATLAS group at Duke.


Working within ATLAS would have been a far less productive and
enjoyable experience without the people I have met along the way.
Thank you first to my boosted and dilepton \ttbar\ resonance
partners-in-crime, Berndt, Bertrand, Emily, Elin, Marcel, Michele,
Oliver, Sarah, and Stephen, who helped me keep my head above water
during my first year of real research.
James, Jiahang, and Samuel have given me indispensable feedback and
guidance as I have continued my studies.
I am particularly thankful for my many CERN friends who were not
directly involved in my research, but who forced me to socialize,
travel, and enjoy myself while away from home.


To my ATLAS officemates and friends---Bennie C, Dave, Kevin ``K1'',
Chen, Lei, and Mia ``The Cat''---I am grateful for all the time we had
(and will have) together.
I am equally thankful for the support of my friends outside the ATLAS
group, especially Aline, Bonnie, Jon, Kevin ``K2'', Mallory, Sarah,
Sean, Sukrit, and Venkitesh.

%% TOO MUCH
To my ATLAS officemates and friends---Bennie C, my redhead valentine
who went out of his way to befriend me the summer before I began
graduate school;
Dave, with whom I commiserated about and questionable beer and the
``features'' that constantly appear in ATLAS software;
Kevin ``K1'', my longtime Duke \ttbar\ buddy who continues to wake up
on Saturday mornings for round-the-globe strategy game sessions;
Chen, who became my Duke \ttbar\ buddy and Chinese tea importer;
Lei, who pinned up her heartthrobs above my desk so I could enjoy them
too;
and Mia ``The Cat'', who always reminded me that I was wrong---I am
grateful for all the time we had (and will have) together.
I am equally thankful for the support of the friends I did not have
to work with,
especially my five-year neighbor, co-president, and Charlie Brown
aficionado, Bonnie;
Aline, whose desserts single-handedly got me through graduate school;
my lunch-, crazy-project-, and student government buddy, Kevin ``K2'';
Jon, who wasted three of my fall semesters by introducing me to
fantasy football;
Sarah, who always seemed to lose to me in fantasy football but still
made me cookies;
my first year office neighbor and Photoshop prankster, Sukrit, who is
always laughing contagiously;
Venkitesh, my first mentee and video game connoisseur;
and my one-year roommate and concert buddy, Sean.

I would also like to acknowledge those not affiliated with the
department or the university---particularly my soccer teammates,
neighbors, and college friends: your perspective from outside my field
of research was invaluable.


My family has always been immensely supportive of me and my
adventures for the last twenty-eight years.
My parents, Mark and Nan, and brother, Stephen, never questioned my
ambitions and helped me realize them.
My aunts, uncles, cousins, and grandparents have gone out of their way
to be interested in my endeavors and to voice their encouragement, and
for that I am extremely grateful.


Finally, I would like to thank the numerous professors, teachers,
administrators, staff members, friends, and colleagues that have
helped make me who I am but whose contributions I cannot include
in a limited number of words.
You have my gratitude.
