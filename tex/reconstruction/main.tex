\chapter{Particle and Event Reconstruction}
\label{chap:reco}

After the digitization step, each event is a collection of hits in the
various subdetectors. In order to extract physically meaningful
quantities from these hits, a set of reconstruction algorithms has
been designed to find patterns in the maelstrom, thereby
reconstructing what happened in the collision. In the following
chapter, the various reconstruction algorithms will be discussed along
with the physical particles to which they are associated.
